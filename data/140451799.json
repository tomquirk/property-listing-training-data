It will appeal those who relish a challenge, are highly creative, love architecture and have the capacity to see the potential in a property and immediately know how best to tap into it.<br/><br/>Only those who are prepared to roll their sleeves up and get dirty should enquire.  This property will inspire bespoke builders, seasoned renovators or someone looking for something completely unique to put their own style to.<br/><br/>What is on offer you ask?   <br/><br/>An ingeniously creative, architect designed, sprawling residence (constructed 1990), with an interesting floor plan across three levels with suspended slab/concrete walls showing excellent structural integrity throughout.<br/><br/>The home incorporates architectural influences that include the Spanish Hacienda style with arched outdoor patio overlooking the inground pool, featuring raked ceilings with exposed beams and glazed concrete roof tiles.   <br/><br/>A most interesting feature is the sloped glass solarium/conservatory, designed for a year round vege garden, or at the very least a beautiful room for your favourite plants.   This room is positioned at the front entry of the home making a bold statement to all who enter.<br/><br/>The interior is dedicated to multiple compartmentalised rooms that invoke a mid-century vibe with features like solid timber panel ceilings and large exterior glass windows & doors.   Many of the interior walls are constructed of block & concrete, contributing to making this a thermally balanced home in all seasons.  A suspended slab roof-top garden can be accessed via a spiral timber & iron stair case from the central lounge area.  There are plenty more captivating features to take in on inspection. <br/><br/>Completely hidden from view from the bitumen road access, this private abode is conveniently located just minutes (2.9 km ) to Lindisfarne & Terranora Primary School & Terranora Shopping Village, with additional shopping and community facilities in Tweed Heads South.<br/><br/>This project is a 'gut job', ready and waiting to be reclaimed from years of vegetation that has grown up around it.   <br/><br/>The 4.48 Ha (11.07 acres) easterly aspected, forested parcel offers ocean views and easterly breezes, just beyond trees that could be potentially cleared in accordance with Asset Protection Zone Management and because the house is mostly block/concrete, it will go a long way to meeting current BAL  (Bushfire Attack Level) requirements.<br/><br/>* Please note:-  the notations made to some of the images for this property that were taken in 2008 are provided as a visual reference to what the original home looked like.<br/><br/>This interesting property is ready and waiting for the challenge to be accepted by someone with vision for the potential that lies here.
