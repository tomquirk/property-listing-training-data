Sitting on a colossal 18 acres of stunningly lush subtropical land with barely any neighbours in sight (save for the local wildlife), this property is a gorgeous paradise and has endless potential. <br/><br/>On site is a huge spring fed dam, a quaint three-bedroom home, a vast outdoor entertaining terrace with brick barbecue, an immense patio, and a cosy deck, and all with breathtaking views of the dense treescape that surrounds the property. With so much space and so many possibilities, this property must be seen to be believed!<br/><br/>Some of its countless benefits include:<br/><br/>-  Enormous 18-acre (7.34 ha) block with massive spring fed dam that's always full, four sheds, two horse stables and water tank<br/>-  Vast entertainment patio, sprawling paved entertainment terrace with brick barbecue, and cosy deck off master<br/>-  Spacious two-to-four-bedroom home surrounded by stunning dense treescape and including rumpus, study, modern kitchen, expansive tiled lounge and dining area with fireplace, and huge carpeted lounge<br/>-  Single lockup garage plus double carport with shade sail and another single carport off to the side<br/>-  Unique acreage opportunity primed for development - perfect for horse owners, truck drivers, business owners, farmers, home builders, investors, or developers<br/><br/>The 7.35 ha of land is thriving with life and populated by towering established trees, making it perfect for a dreamy acreage lifestyle. You could easily build a grand new estate, a charming ridgetop cottage or a resort-style villa and rent out the current home for additional income. There is even scope for you to build a successful trucking or heavy machinery business with plenty of room for you to store an array of large vehicles. <br/><br/>Currently four sheds sit on this vast block of land, along with two horse stables and an enormous spring fed dam that's always full. This allows you the opportunity to bring along the family pets, including the horses, as there's just so much space and plenty of fresh water for happy horses or even happier livestock.  <br/><br/>If farming or animals aren't your thing though, this sensational subtropical setting could easily become a remote sanctuary for you and your family to enjoy. The current home could be extended or rented out and has oodles of space for you to experience a peaceful lifestyle.<br/><br/>The charming brick-and-timber lowset is surrounded by swaying palms, tropical gardens and neat shrubs that flank the double carport with shade sail, single lockup garage and single carport off to the side. A long patio acts as an inviting beacon at the front of the property and would make a lavish space for outdoor parties. <br/><br/>Entering within you'll find a spacious carpeted lounge with shimmering chandelier as well as a sprawling tiled living and dining area complete with a rustic brick fireplace and charismatic exposed timber beams. Delightfully air conditioned, both areas would make superb zones for hosting large gatherings or lovely areas for daily family relaxation.<br/><br/>The huge, modern kitchen is hidden behind a brick wall and fitted with a surplus of cabinetry and laminate countertops, as well as a gas stovetop and dishwasher. It is further joined by a separate rumpus which could act as a man cave, games room, home office or third bedroom.  <br/><br/>Two large, carpeted bedrooms are available to occupants, both with ceiling fans and the master with access out to a private deck. A third bedroom or multi-purpose room is also on offer and boasts a trendy black barn door that adds to the country atmosphere of the home. All the rooms are serviced by a massive black-and-white bathroom with stylish glass block features and a shower-over-tub. <br/><br/>A paved entertainment terrace at the rear of the home completes the tour. It is expansive and beautifully shaded by the thick surrounding canopy, and includes a brick barbecue off to the side for cosy winter entertaining beneath a starry night sky.<br/><br/>Other highlights include:<br/><br/>-  Alarm system<br/>-  Security screens<br/>-  Water tank<br/><br/>A spectacular find in beautiful Buccan surrounds, this home may be secluded, but that doesn't mean you miss out on easy accessibility to all local amenities.<br/><br/>-  6.4 km to Buccan Conservation Park<br/>-  6.7 km to Village Links golf course<br/>-  6.8 km to Wharf Street Shopping Mall<br/>-  6.8 km to Logan Village State School<br/>-  7.7 km to Logan Village Marketplace<br/>-  7.8 km to King's Christian College Logan Village Campus<br/>-  10.2 km to Holmview Central Shopping Centre<br/>-  13.7 km to Windaroo Valley State High <br/>-  14.7 km Beenleigh train station<br/><br/>Contact Emily Xiong today and bring your wildest acreage dreams to fruition!<br/><br/>We are committed to the health and safety of our customers and staff, and their families.
