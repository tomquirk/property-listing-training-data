This very appealing flood free land is a good balance of cleared level land with the balance being lightly wooded with great tracks for riding. There is nothing between you & the ocean but acres of lovely national park to explore. Ride your horse or trail bike down to the beach for a private beachside experience. <br/>Horse lovers will appreciate the 5 level, well fenced paddocks, with separate riding tracks throughout the entire 17 acre property, and the well constructed stables & purpose built sheds. After a long ride, simply dive into the sparkling new salt water pool to cool off & refresh. No neighbours to worry about, and nothing but peace & quiet to do your own thing, with no-one watching!  Enjoy the benefits of a lifestyle here that would be the envy of many. <br/>The well built brick home is constructed with a steel frame & is designed to accommodate those who live on the land. Enter through your mud room & on through to the spacious living area, all tiled for practicality. Ducted air conditioning throughout means year round comfort, bedrooms are generous in size & have built in robes. <br/>The updated kitchen is complete with Bosh oven, granite benchtops & glass spashback, & provision for dishwasher & plumbed refrigeration already in place. The dining & kitchen area is nicely separated from the main lounge room. At the far end of the kitchen is a very convenient butler's pantry with views over the lush paddocks, pool & entertainment area. The superbly renovated bathroom is the place to relax & soak in the 1.7m tub, having heated towel rail & LED feature lighting. Apart from the main house, a comfortably finished sleep-out is the ideal solution for the teenager, elderly parent, or perhaps to rent out down the track. A handy toilet & provision for a shower and a second laundry are already in place. The peace & quiet are two aspects of the property that are rarely found on any property that offers so much in so many ways. <br/>Those wanting to use the land to create an income, you'll be excited about the 200 odd species of well established commercial bamboo that can be harvested & sold if you want to. As the plants are all clumping varieties ( bar one), these plants are much sought after. A shade house/Igloo & associated plant nursery materials will all stay with the property for a convenient transition for the new owner. A permanent stream running throughout the land, including three dams, gives access for water if needed, however the current owner has never needed to irrigate. This plus multiple large water tanks ensure you'll never be without water. Five well fenced paddocks are completely set up with water troughs & shelter, making this the ideal horse owners property in so many ways. <br/>With several varieties of mature fruit & nut trees, and a beautifully landscaped garden, this all adds to the appeal of this private, peaceful property. All together, there is way too much to tell about here, as this really is a must see property to appreciate all that's on offer. <br/>Being in such a great location, this might also be an ideal property for a landscape gardener, horticulturalist or plant nursery, with so much of the initial work already done. <br/>Please call for directions, as the GPS doesn't give correct advice or travel time. Book your inspection today, as this exceptional property is one of a kind & is sure to impress. <br/><br/>", "images": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link":
