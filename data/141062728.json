Cutting Edge Property is proud to present a stunning executive home here at 19 Champion Drive in the Fairways Estate.<br/><br/>The entire house has been built to maximize the views from this carefully chosen block. Entertaining family and friends will be an absolute delight on the expansive rear patio and the sense of open space can be felt from both the living/kitchen area and the amazing fully self-contained guest quarters.<br/><br/>Stunning quality and construction from floor to ceiling by Townsville's best builder, New Home Solutions.<br/><br/>Of course this house features everything you could possibly want in a home including a dedicated theatre room, impressive laundry with heaps of storage and stone benches, a solar power system to keep those energy bills down and luxurious floor to ceiling tiles in all of the bathrooms... but there are a few areas where the owners really put thought into their design.<br/><br/>The master bedroom suite is the ultimate parents retreat featuring quality plantation shutters for those lazy Sunday morning sleep ins. There is ample storage in the incredibly well organised walk-in robe. The open en-suite features his and hers vanities and you will absolutely love the amazing rain shower.<br/><br/>The kitchen is the heart of every home and we have literally never seen one like this. The amazing breakfast bar is cleverly designed to seat 6 guests. You could have the most incredible sushi rolling party! Of course there is an expansive stone island bench with clever storage underneath and heaps of soft close drawers. The sink is recessed so that you can easily wipe down the bench when cooking and the clever faucet was custom sourced for this home. There is a professional 6 burner gas stove for the family chef and even a mini butler's pantry to store your espresso machine off the main bench. Rounding out this excellent space is a full walk-in pantry with a custom glass door.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most unique feature of this home is that the 4th bedroom is also a fully self-contained guest suite featuring an extra large living space, kitchenette, sweeping views of the golf course and an en-suite that is better than you will find in most homes. If you have relatives visiting from out of town, a teenager that really needs their own space or an elderly relative... you will never find better accommodation for them.<br/><br/>In the afternoons prevailing sea breezes off of Cleveland Bay keep the fully shaded patio cool. This 643m2 block is located overlooking a beautiful lake and the 5th green... which is the signature hole of the course. There is excellent parking for your golf buggy right in the backyard. It's too bad you can't drive right through the fence (but the entrance to the course is only a few houses away).<br/><br/>The Fairways Estate is located just 10 minutes from the Townsville CBD and only a few minutes walk to the beautiful Ross River walking paths. For those of you viewing this property from out of town, this home is located just minutes away from Townsville's 3 largest employers, James Cook University, Townsville University Hospital and Lavarack Barracks Army Base.<br/><br/>Be Quick! There is simply nothing like our beautiful home at 19 Champion Drive, Rosslea. Nature lovers and sports enthusiasts alike are sure to be entranced by this modern beauty. Make sure you see us here, this weekend!", "images": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/4476fcba7efff0c87607c7446f76f2b2e4e54d877769c6e12a772f2f66f161d8/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/27727bb9f6c91399e3fa43de41a0029164216d23d9bab7b6fc0f04b40ff78593/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/0d750d4833972eba419fdbdcf3e916ed55f19bf1cfbe718a352a31977cf99248/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/b24a76ff9fc0d4ed8ce9d70e639bea1295aa566e3d7b7f13d16c84d06d30d96e/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/ffba5b85b7303f6f55d20e51e2bae162b3a6066279e96c82c7360c4896535f35/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/03ee9f689f0a471e44013071316f214df3fee3c4be6199e7d321244e8fdc239b/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/07dd6109ec70cec9ad6f0d379f48a3efba431127e8a603db32a1bfce91467c4c/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/5067b734b7e38d5da4cc736c9442a2bf11e83834f89b64cd2d9fe89f97fd5e37/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/573afc522211299ea0575c5a6276263dee3d4953539526c9cfea51fd1e862278/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/59a49cd674d320ef2ac3ab341b6fc68cce8eb9f2a252b84b30e10eec53fdfa2a/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/5c6eca1672560c50d7a27f25bac0b163ef51dcb97da9ae623a1fa2af28a21a6e/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/6cd6f7f71d896991a1eea4b0f946206822df111c60fe8101297d874fec39d0c8/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/b8b43ef79e332853383416a5c4615eca647fc00658c2c8d63a737545c06b7abb/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/f65f0a7ccd43b6688dad4160f1ec2147c67ee8ede9a013844b8bf5abad36a3a0/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/637cbccb4a323fc4dda64842c0222c6bc5dcb5dfe3804411d8936c46352fa9d6/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/b6ed40998b640147c579217b9b2114acdc32db877d9c5c8efc2ce230601a220a/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/616f0006f077d185d8632128b93de177669f99acc8ac42298ff81dbab06c8f45/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/d44d8f7e51688e46abbe7193608c5d4b962982e67c3e81099d42b5d07a844bf2/image.jpg"}], "images_floorplans": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/71ee89d6781018a063aa036a943ea39d4db6d03f8c563711f5316105624758f7/image.jpg"}], "listers": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.Lister", "id": "2996995", "name": "Rob Levy", "agent_id": null, "job_title": "Director", "url": "https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/rob-levy-2996995?cid={cid}", "phone": "0448282029", "email": null}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.Lister", "id": "2997519", "name": "Abigail Fairbanks", "agent_id": null, "job_title": "Licensed Real Estate Agent", "url": "https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/abigail-fairbanks-2997519?cid={cid}", "phone": "0418138577", "email": null}], "inspections": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.Inspection", "start_time": "2023-01-22T12:00:00+10:00", "end_time": "2023-01-22T12:30:00+10:00", "label": "Open tomorrow 12:00pm", "label_short": "Open tomorrow"}]}
