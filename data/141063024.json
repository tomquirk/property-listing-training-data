The modern look makes the home feel open and spacious. Attention to detail was vital in the building of this home. Simple yet subtle colour schemes give you a sense of calm while providing a fantastic, homely feeling.<br/><br/> At the centre of the home, you will be welcomed by the simple yet elegantly designed kitchen, offering caesarstone benchtops, a built-in dishwasher, and an abundance of storage. Breakfast is a breeze, with the island bench overhanging perfectly for you to enjoy the most important meal of the day.<br/><br/> You\u2019ll enjoy comfort all year round, with ceiling fans throughout and air-conditioning in the living area and master bedroom.
