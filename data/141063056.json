And they're vintage now. But don't let that scare you off from this brilliant and spacious family home which retains all its retro glory. If you're tickled by the idea of bold, patterned walls and flooring, a sweet selection of chandeliers, and more shades of brown and orange than you could have imagined in one place, you'll be in heaven here. But even if '80s styling isn't for you, there's enormous scope for renovation here - literally, with the footprint of the house itself being over 180sqm.<br/> <br/>Every room in this house is well sized with a considered and therefore excellent floorplan layout, from the bedrooms to the living spaces, and even the laundry. In fact, there's a storeroom off the laundry which is fantastic if you enjoy preserving food, have loads of seasonal clothes or sports equipment, or prefer to shop in bulk. There's a sunroom, which is a beautiful spot where children can play in their own space or you can soak up a few rays while kicking back in your favourite armchair, and attached is a bonus room which is just as versatile. Convert it to a games room, set up a bar and a stereo, and invite friends around for some old-fashioned fun.<br/> <br/>Features Include:<br/>Amazing bones for a fabulous & large family home<br/>3 big bedrooms<br/>1 bathroom<br/>Massive renovation potential with current styling circa 1985<br/>Zoned R12: potential to subdivide into 2 large blocks while retaining the original home<br/><br/>Formal dining room & 2 communal living areas<br/>Plus enclosed patio & bonus room<br/>Large kitchen with double stainless-steel sink, breakfast bar & built-in pantry<br/>Huge main bedroom & large secondary bedrooms<br/>Bathroom with shower, tub & separate powder room<br/>Laundry with double trough & enormous walk-in linen closet<br/>Additional hallway linen cupboards<br/>Wood doors & door frames<br/>Original vintage carpets and tiling<br/>Period style lighting and chandeliers<br/>High ceiling with decorative cornicing<br/>Vertical blinds throughout<br/>2 cooling air-conditioning units<br/>Security screened windows & doors & security alarm<br/>Tiled front verandah with decorative rail<br/>Gas hot water system (approx 3 years old)<br/>Large front lawn area with manual reticulation<br/>Multiple fruit trees<br/>Garden shed<br/>Single car garage<br/>Gated side entry<br/>1935m2 fenced block with subdivision potential<br/> <br/>The large block size of 1935sqm plus the R12.5 zoning means you can potentially subdivide and build a new home out the back while also retaining the current one. Then again, you also have the option of keeping it all to yourself and doing whatever you please with the backyard! There's scope for a complete overhaul as it's a bit of a blank slate at the moment. Also worth noting is that this property is being sold as it is - what you see is what you get! The current owner has never lived in the home so cannot make any guarantees; however the usual process of building and pest inspections will form part of the contract. All in all, this is a perfect time capsule of life in the 1980s, and a rare opportunity for a venture into nostalgia.
