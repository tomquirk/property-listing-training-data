Kirra developments have had enormous success, with off-the-plan buyers flocking to secure their own piece of beachside paradise. Many developers quoting projects selling out in a matter of weeks, with dozens of ready-to-go buyers missing out.<br/><br/>There has been a DA Approved for this block, now expired, consisting for 9 apartments and totalling 1,132 sqm in internal living space.<br/><br/>This home could also be the last stand-alone home available so close to the beach. If you're looking for your own Kirra beach house - this is it! You're far enough away from the noise of the holiday areas - but close enough that's an easy walk to the beach, caf\u00e9s, shops, bars, restaurants and clubs.<br/><br/>Kirra is the go-to suburb of the southern Gold Coast, and rightly so. The Gold Coast International Airport is only a 5 minute drive away. The state's capital, Brisbane, is only an hour's drive, and Byron Bay is 45 minutes away. The beaches here are north-facing, allowing the predominant south swell to wrap in and creates clean and consistent peeling waves. This is why surfers from all around the world consider the beaches and waves in this area some of the best in the world. This is why developers and city council are heavily investing in the area with projects, light rail and infrastructure.<br/><br/>Agent's notes: This exclusive opportunity will suit anyone looking for a development project or their own beach house. This is the closest stand-alone home to the beach and is positioned in one of the quieter areas of Kirra. No matter what your motivation is - you cannot go wrong with this one.<br/><br/>There are new two developments being built next to this property and close by. Based on the build plans and the building's positioning - there are still good views and privacy for this property at 5 Winston Street. A detailed report on these developments and site plans can be made available by contacting the agent (Ash Witty).", "images": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/b885c019bda5b77d6df0384f5c4a29147a310ad9e03a582c0b149acc071dd308/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/fa59b1ca23882408b0016b9523fdeab83c9124033269e6e1cadc3a0b16a46dec/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/a02c9b1931e0c45e1f367dc942d073d6b5ee3b569c92f779b47dcd8a729f5c9b/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/b7aff3ceffae988b954e9822ab506c356f88100ebe3b75d0b26af52dc0d35086/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/20885ac14676981fd83d6e28b2dfa305396b3655f5635763572a6eb249a9fe41/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/7b44111fcb40c3ed856206b4927438c73241305f6e3c35d9b35fbcb374eb0eff/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/25283ddab3d60dadbbc6c68ad9cc4ab4e36f47f4883d2cc722c77a42bfa055f5/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/ea12c731ca782549813d4c5faf6f4f7a9e28962d61d996d5cea65a1b7bedb2e8/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/70e67fe5b0ffdfcb03894d3e9ea832e67bca82044b90f6e654f047ad7a378d07/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/65c6e80453f03f8b4543fb9cf208134710f09ecadca36b98cc6dfe7defa3547c/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/94700c8d977a6b40ed8ed0a3cc1de5eb90af6521062d62712d538ac1043642c0/image.jpg"}], "images_floorplans": [], "listers": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.Lister", "id": "2035970", "name": "Ash Witty", "agent_id": "c0fb1109-f23f-4570-b8f3-b520f91f1efb", "job_title": "Licensed Real Estate Agent QLD/NSW", "url": "https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/ash-witty-2035970?cid={cid}", "phone": "0424792244", "email": null}], "inspections": []}
