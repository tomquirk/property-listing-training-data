In no less than an established, in-demand, low-density, near-city suburb. Makes it a no-brainer really. And you get to start a new Pinterest board. Winning.<br/><br/>Location wise you're 350m from Walter Road West with its #60 bus to the city (approx. 6km) and host of popular local eateries, including 60 on Walter, Vin & Van Cafe, Big Dog Burgers, and Naab. St Peters Primary is across the road or you're in the Inglewood Primary School catchment. If you've got littles, or a fam is in the plan, there are three (!) child care centres within 500m. The bubs (human or fur) will adore the open space at the nearby Grand Prom Reserve. And then there's Beaufort Street, an easy 1.1km stroll or ride.
