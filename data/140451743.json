The elevated apartment overlooks the leafy canopy and gardens below from its high perch two levels above the street. The apartment is located in a private rear position at the back corner of the dual cube shaped boutique building.<br/><br/>Recently renovated, and spacious, this two-bedroom apartment has a stylish new kitchen and bathroom. The kitchen has granite benchtops, white tiles and surfaces, a double sink and plenty of storage space above and beneath the benches. A white dishwasher and oven with electric stove complement the lightness of the cabinetry. The kitchen flows into the living and dining areas and patio beyond. The securely enclosed patio, surrounded by full glass doors and windows, lets in plenty of light and breezes. The apartment has security bars on the windows for extra peace of mind. The stained wood front door presents a bold quality entry for residents and guests alike.<br/><br/>Boasting a neutral colour scheme in the tiled living areas, the bedrooms are carpeted and have full-length built-in cupboards plus ceiling fans. The bathroom has striking dark porcelain tiles on the floor, a spacious glass shower and a separate bath in which to languish, as well as a stylish vanity with raised rectangular sink, and a new toilet.<br/><br/>The enormous lock-up garage, located directly below the apartment, is large enough for two cars plus plenty of extra storage space. Built in solid mid-century style, the apartment complex has a grassed garden space in which to relax and a Hills Hoist for hanging out the washing. The laundry is located nearby, on the ground floor inside the lock-up garage. <br/><br/>Cook Street has a fantastic location close to the shops at Yeronga as well as Fairfield Road and the railway line to the city or west. The apartments are a low maintenace brick build, with walk up stairs and no lift or pool to contribute to higher Body Corporate fees.<br/><br/>Solidly built, private, renovated apartments such as this are in high demand.
