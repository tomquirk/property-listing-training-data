Spanning approximately 1.36-acres and surrounded Mother Nature, it is literally just footsteps away from the iconic John Forrest National Park at the end of the street. <br/><br/>This leafy oasis resembles the type of resort-style living you would usually only find on a family holiday. Instead, you will find yourself living everyday like it's a family vacation, surrounded by jarrah, marri, and eucalyptus trees and local birdlife, an orchard of citrus, herbs and vegetables and your own personal pool, spa, and tennis court \u2013 all only 30 min from the heart of the Perth CBD. <br/><br/>Welcoming you inside is an open-plan family area with gleaming timber floorboards, split and ducted air-conditioning plus a gas bayonet for heating. The spacious formal-lounge room next door and features two gorgeous chandeliers, a fan-forced Jarrahdale Jumbo wood fireplace and exquisite wooden parquetry flooring. <br/><br/>A massive separate office/games area has its own private side entrance for clients if running your business from home. Its pleasant northern aspect allows plenty of natural sunlight to filter in, complementing character slate flooring, lush green window views and ample power points for technological appliances. <br/><br/>A separate fourth or \"guest\" bedroom at the back of the house is large in size, has full-height mirrored built-in robes and even extends out to a side deck and spacious entertaining patio, via double French doors. In between, the master suite will impress you with its walk-in robe, a parents' retreat area where you can sit back and look out at the surrounding greenery and an over-sized ensuite.<br/><br/>There is a double linen press too, as well as a fully-tiled and renovated family bathroom with a large rain shower, a toilet, heat lamps, a heated towel rack and twin \"his and hers\" stone vanities. Doubling as the heart and soul of the floor plan is a cleverly-revamped open-plan dining area and \"chef's kitchen\" with quality 40mm-thick Caesar Stone bench tops, an island breakfast bar for casual meals, double sinks, high-end tap fittings, a water filter, Fagor Induction-cooktop, range-hood and twin pyrolytic-oven appliances, a stainless-steel Asko dishwasher, tiled splashbacks and excellent Hafele soft-closing drawers, sleek white cabinetry and pull-out bins. The laundry addition has been renovated to include floor-to-ceiling tiling, stone bench tops and access into a fully-tiled 'third' bathroom with a shower, toilet and vanity.<br/><br/>The dining space extends outdoors to a fabulous alfresco deck and large pitched patio that encourage covered entertaining in the most secluded and picturesque of settings. Only inches away, you will find an eight-seater outdoor spa and a shimmering below-ground swimming pool beside a delightful lemon tree. There is also a generous storage/pool shed adjacent, as well as a two-car carport, heaps of secure parking space and a barn/workshop with room for two cars parked tandem under the carport, a lockable remote-controlled roller door, power and a handy mezzanine storage level. <br/><br/>One the other side of the pool and spa you will find a beautiful firepit courtyard for those chilly winter nights and an entertaining deck and gazebo that stretches several metres, giving the most sought-after view of John Forrest National Park. It also overlooks a self-sustaining lake on the property, which fills up from a creek that starts at the top of the hill and is home to broods of ducklings that appear several times a year. The deck also overlooks the impossible-to-miss full-size Australian Open-style tennis court, perfect for the novice and pro alike.<br/> <br/>As you head further outside, you will find yourself walking amongst a fully-reticulated small citrus orchard, which blooms annually with beautiful oranges, mandarins, grapefruits and other unique citrus fruits. On the other side, you will find a similarly-reticulated herb and vegetable garden that will complement your pantry staples in the kitchen rather nicely.<br/><br/>As you step outside this highly-secure and gated estate, walking only 200 metres will put you right at the entrance of John Forrest National Park and its array of breathtaking nature trails, which will take you through the historic Swan View Tunnel and all the way up to National Park Falls. Living on the edge of the Darling Scarp brings you many benefits and advantages, including basing yourself within a very close proximity to four major supermarkets - including IGA, Coles and a brand new Woolworths, accessible health and medical services, local schools (Guildford Grammar School is only 10 min away) and the iconic Guildford village. The centre of Midland and major arterial roads for easy access to the city, Perth Airport and the Swan Valley are only minutes away. <br/><br/>This National Park oasis is a rare sight to behold. Give yourself an escape from the city and live every day like you're on vacation. It's time to finally put your feet up, once and for all!<br/><br/><br/>Features include, but are not limited to:<br/><br/>\u2022\tRemote-controlled driveway access gates <br/>\u2022\tSpacious and
