Personally, I just love the backyard. A great pool with amazing views. But in Everton Hills overall I just think this is amazing value for money that a family really shouldn't want for anything.<br/><br/>6 Things I Really Love!<br/>Amazing Views - You're going to love your morning coffee every day from your front deck. You can watch the world go by with your beautiful mountain and suburban views.<br/>The Whole Block Is Usable - With attractive brick fencing and lockable gates you can utilise the entirety of your land (instead of just creating a pretty garden that you have to maintain). There's room for sheds, more car accommodation, basketball courts.... Whatever you need.<br/>It's large - there are some genuine separate spaces for your family to escape to including multiple living spaces inside and out. There's a living space, a purpose-built office, a great outdoor room, a large garage and much, much more!<br/>Potential - this home could be truly anything! Anyone with a keen eye for renovation can turn this into a real beauty. There's nothing that needs immediate work. But those who know what they're doing will love working on the various parts and taking advantage of this elevated location.<br/>Built for outdoor living - with a great outdoor living area you can enjoy the best of Queensland's climate all year round. The pool is large and encompasses a waterfall and spa.<br/>The unbeatable location - you can literally sell your car and walk everywhere. Plus, it's only a short drive to Brisbane's hottest new dining precinct complete with rooftop bars! The location is also functional with two supermarkets, the best schools and public transport all within a couple of minutes walk.<br/><br/>This Hills District classic is an amazing combination of style, functionality & size that your family are going to love for years to come. Or for investors, you're looking at blue-chip stock with a location that will grow in years to come.<br/><br/>The heart of every family home is the kitchen, it's the place where the family gathers and this is certainly made easy with a large gourmet kitchen positioned centrally to the dining, lounge and outdoor entertaining areas.<br/><br/>The other half of this floor comprises a full-sized lounge room and great access to a large outdoor area that looks over the pool.<br/><br/>Its original features comprise of three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a dining area, an ample-sized kitchen, and a living room which leads straight out to a great undercover entertaining area and private garden, complete with a secluded pool. Perfect for parties or just quiet relaxation.<br/><br/>The gardens are plentiful and easy to maintain. The front has a beautiful Australiana feel and the back is the perfect mix of beauty and low maintenance. <br/><br/>The block itself is excellent in size & shape. Providing plenty of room to do what you want to do now, but it also provides plenty of opportunities should you want to expand in the future.<br/><br/>Other location advantages:<br/>-20 minutes to Brisbane airport<br/>-25 minutes to Brisbane city<br/>-45 minutes to Sunshine Coast<br/>-1 \u00bd hours to Gold Coast.<br/>-Close to award-winning public & private schools<br/>- Massive Investment in the area including the new Park Lane dining precinct, Everton Park homemaker centre, and the new Brook Tavern.<br/>- One of the newest and most innovative parks on the Northside is a short walk away<br/>- Shopping districts in all directions with Arana Plaza, Park Lane, Brookside Shopping Centre, Chermside Shopping Centre, Stafford City & more all a short walk or drive away.<br/>- New hotel complex being built just down the road.<br/>- You can walk to the train station in under 8 minutes<br/>- The local high school is only a short walk away (and the primary school a short drive).
