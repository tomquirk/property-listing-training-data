Set on a generous allotment of approximately \u00c3\u0083\u00c6'\u00c3\u0086'\u00c3\u0083\u00e2\u20ac'\u00c3\u0083\u00c6'\u00a2\u20ac\u00c3\u0083\u2026\u00a1\u00bd an acre (2020Sqm or thereabouts), built in 2017, fully fenced (with remote entry front gate) and complimented by low maintenance  landscaped gardens and the bonus of garaging for seven plus cars, the contemporary styled, two storey home (approximately 346Sqm of floor area) and grounds have been fastidiously maintained in as new condition.  The versatility of the cleverly designed flow through nature of the entire living space, including a media room, enables you to use the various zones in whatever manner you desire, making this a home both families and entertainers alike will appreciate.  <br/>Luxuriously appointed for your living and entertaining pleasure the craftsman built home boasts many extras such as a very high bush fire rating (BAL 29), steel screens, double tinted tempered glass windows, two heat pumps coupled with a heat transfer system adding to the efficiency when distributing air around the home, quality stone bench tops in the kitchen (the breakfast bar has a waterfall end), bathrooms also with stone tops, Tasmanian Oak floating flooring and architraves, plush carpeting, quality window furnishings and added insulation and sound proofing where required etc. etc. (the remainder you will see at inspection).<br/>For those wishing to avoid stairs the beauty of this floor plan is that it offers complete daily living on  the top level, having flat entry from the front door or the double garage.  The top floor comprises a light airy lounge with easy access to the designer kitchen featuring subway tiling and incorporating more than adequate bench and cupboard space, lots of drawers, a dishwasher and a built in microwave oven and a good size dining area adjoining a casual dining/entertaining room that flows through to the outdoor deck and barbeque area (space for any form of entertaining whether it be a sophisticated dinner party, a casual barbeque with a few friends and family or for the more adventurous, entertaining on a grand scale if desired).   Completing this multi zoned entertaining space is the very comfortable media room (the projector and screen will remain).  There is a separate storage closet (ideal for keeping items like suitcases which can take up a lot of space),  three bedrooms, the master located to the front of the home, with a wall of mirrored built in robes and an opulent en-suite, bedrooms 2 & 3 (one currently used as an office) both double and also with built in mirrored robes and there is a beautiful family bathroom and multiple toilets throughout (no waiting in line here).  <br/>From the upper storey there is an internal staircase to the downstairs area which comprises a large recreation room and studio/multi purpose room both offering endless uses, perhaps a spacious home office away from the hustle and bustle of the household, even a  teenagers or parents retreat etc., the choice is yours !  There is also a bathroom and another store room on this level.<br/>A great addition to this property is the amount of garage space. You will have the convenience of a double garage (internal access to the home) to the front of the residence with a single garage to the rear of the home and the piece de resistance being a huge separate garage/workshop set well apart from the home capable of accommodating 4 cars (approximately 11 x 6m) and having higher the average ceilings that will cater for your boat, camper, caravan etc.  This shed would be perfect for the avid car collector or generally anyone wanting a larger than average workshop already equipped with loads of power points, a wood heater and a toilet.  Indeed the handyman's home away from home ! <br/>Reflecting amazing attention to detail inside and out, a drive-by of this property will not suffice.  Viewing is by appointment only and is essential to fully appreciate this enviable lifestyle opportunity.
