Residents will love everything this location has to offer. From being just a 2 minute stroll to the ocean, or 3 minute drive to Cosmopolitan Jetty Road, 5 minute walk to the marina and restaurants and everything the area has on offer, while still being far enough away to avoid the hustle and bustle of the central Glenelg district.<br/><br/>Quayview has been meticulously designed through well thought out floorplans by the well renowned local designer Tectvs, backed with their impressive track record of designing some of Adelaide's most well renowned apartment buildings. Quayview provides a perfect blend of soft timbers, attractive colours and world class views of the Marine and ocean which are a 5 minute walk away. <br/><br/>With high quality fixtures and fittings given throughout, features include floor to ceiling sliding glass doors, large balconies and a collection of well laid out floorplans, nothing has been left to chance. <br/><br/>What Quayview represents is the opportunity to buy into not just an architectural gem that's been designed with absolute precision, but to also buy into a lifestyle that only a location like Adelphi Terrace can offer. Being a boutique apartment building, residents can be assured this will be a primarily owner-occupied group that is not being used as a short term holiday stay building, like so many others in Glenelg. <br/><br/>Whether you are downsizing, upgrading, or simply interested in a coastal lifestyle, you will find your home here at Quayview.<br/><br/>All information provided has been obtained from sources we believe to be accurate, however, we cannot guarantee the information is accurate and we accept no liability for any errors or omissions (including but not limited to a property's land size, floor plans and size, building age and condition) Interested parties should make their own inquiries and obtain their own legal advice.
