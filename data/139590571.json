This is a home that has been built to a standard, not a price, and it certainly shows. Architecturally, the homestead style home features bullnose verandahs with turned posts, hardwood decking, and large feature bay windows that take the magnificent views and bring them right into the home.<br/><br/>Internally, the home is cleverly laid out into two separate and spacious living zones. A large formal living area adjoining the entry leads into a second family zone where the central kitchen joins the dining and family rooms, and a separate sitting room. These areas combine high ceilings and large bay windows to capitalise on the stunning views to the north and exude a feeling of generous space. The central kitchen is a showpiece with black stone benchtops and splashbacks contrasting against natural timber cabinetry and stainless appliances. Ample bench space including a substantial central island bench, and 900mm oven and cooktop ensures even the most avid entertainer will be satisfied. The living zones are punctuated by high set bulkhead ceiling features, with ornate cornices.<br/><br/>Bedrooms are very generously sized, and separately positioned with the master at the front of the home and the second and third bedrooms at the rear. The master is a genuine suite, being over 21m2, plus a generous walk in robe and substantial ensuite where tasteful neutral tones blend with frameless glass and decorative tiling. The second and third bedrooms are also very generously proportioned, and of course include built in robes. Practical features such as a spacious laundry and a mudroom for clean and easy access from outside only add to the liveability of this home.<br/><br/>Fully equipped for comfortable living year round, the home is served with ducted heating and ceiling fans, and the living areas also feature split system air conditioning and a large wood fire heater. Quality blinds and floor coverings sit alongside ornate light fittings and sleek downlights to complete the picture of a quality built home.<br/><br/>Outside the 3,999m2 block is extensively landscaped. Bluestone retaining walls border plantings of advanced European trees, with a variety of weeping, ornamental, and fruit trees and hedges creating an impressive autumnal display. The lawns have been lovingly cared for, and are interspersed with paved walkways, and features including an arbor, sitting area, bird bath and coachlamp. Alongside these features a complementary planting of roses and shrubs create an impressive landscape. Vehicle accommodation is extensive, with a double garage under the house with internal access. There is also a substantial shed of approx. 12m x 7m with an adjoining carport of approx. 4m x 12m. The shed has concrete floor and power and in front of the shed is a large turning apron for larger vehicle access.<br/><br/>Inspections available by private appointment only.<br/>", "images": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/926d2e76fd61ce6c200bb14e43fe14ae834ea199e23d88f52d6d9e340f0e9713/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/e8c3f92d93d5d9dfeb57156c5fb34bca4499357963b7aa7ef36b7168780f79ad/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/f6f5e0e8d332a81f4da77bae7757a9c0817f7295136bd8144e4b78ba9d414d4f/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/9213cb59778c738bcbc59d645bd842eb8b92456fffd4490b45bad5a3d3a78818/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/aaa5ce7c9951e53d30a5f20b58f458ef84be1e89dc657bd1736c05d71543a1f1/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/9445102d780647df63cd8f7ee95ebf2ea0f5a83a3f7a9cbfeaa427e6b800d11a/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/a3d5ae93c1fa932566e1dd4841afa4cbcd941e3dd541289c389b906665766461/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/5cbc9fde862b51d4b9c175aa5ef0992d68e72f79b46371aa9a7887a5268dff47/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/d60d24abb56063645664fa3097afe9f9bc4d88617346256180fc6568b99e94fe/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/d89cb59833b5348d86230b1a407f4dcd67d26dc4be7198b986fe70549cd1edb9/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/12d5dd126ec18512bd9880e90ba0152a5aab8342de3e28f16115a86022d894f5/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/19af83b40f578724b6569ad7bb1d806fa66549c63895dff98b321ee277ae231f/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/a74e3d71b33e669d5fcbe205720845cf4c3f9352a7c6b5fcfc46d01393eb1800/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/e67867ddffc9ecea1daa1ad0e5054728b2840b691d63dd7addf36a4eb83885d0/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/17761c0c991ca5298b0623170531f03cb2f70bdb61bf40ba6965a03f5733eeea/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/57ad9b2e6e679854ed21310e987634e936830214924576bc02b34ce0e358e07c/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/ff5b56b68d73d4fe8bcdd6f6cfd025a840f46254e062511cc2914144eb8f54e6/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/ea42304fb2fc407f745bfb73bc7216b13951f82a9a5cdc7e9a433a17f6de775b/image.jpg"}], "images_floorplans": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/dee862212b0341e62dd99ed1bc40e98de01dd7c04785c7445133934588c13002/image.jpg"}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.MediaItem", "link": "https://i2.au.reastatic.net/1144x888-format=webp/5081b3a11ae7531c9adb4c54467cc1a5ec59790e5e8dd1df8d335176d6b91a17/image.jpg"}], "listers": [{"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.Lister", "id": "2248658", "name": "Joel Murray", "agent_id": "de8b4e34-abe2-4aa3-a0ec-ea276f276b1a", "job_title": "Managing Director", "url": "https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/joel-murray-2248658?cid={cid}", "phone": "0418544180", "email": null}, {"py/object": "realestate_com_au.objects.listing.Lister", "id": "2269586", "name": "Kaye Dixon", "agent_id": "e08b3df5-83b8-43bb-a1f3-94494727ff0a", "job_title": "Licensed Estate Agent", "url": "https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/kaye-dixon-2269586?cid={cid}", "phone": "0438026676", "email": null}], "inspections": []}
