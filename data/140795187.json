Sophisticated and understated contemporary interiors ensure private and secure living here, along with soaring ceiling heights that bring the outer green from the established gardens into this luxurious home. <br/><br/>Even the striking decked walkway taking you from the front gate, past shady gardens and to the main entry door of the house will have you feeling like you are in paradise - and that's before you even step foot inside. A welcoming open-plan living, dining and kitchen area makes an instant first impression with its timber-lined \"Eco Outdoor\" ceilings, stunning stone feature walls from the same company, integrated audio speakers (part of a SONOS surround-sound system), a ceiling fan, a pop-up remote-controlled television, built-in media cabinetry, sliding-door access to the lovely garden entry courtyard and another sliding door that reveals a fabulous timber-lined entertaining alfresco with integrated audio speakers, an in-built fridge, a Franke sink, a mains-gas DCS Fisher and Paykel stainless-steel barbecue/rotisserie and a Condor stainless-steel range hood - all overlooking a sunken firepit and a shimmering below-ground heated reverse-cycle swimming pool and its flowing waterfall feature. What a setting.<br/><br/>Back inside, the kitchen is a dream for any resident chef with its feature tiled bench tops and splashbacks, a hot/cold-water Billi tap, double Franke sinks, a breakfast bar for casual meals, a stainless-steel Qasair range hood, an integrated Liebherr fridge/freezer combination, a Miele Induction cooktop, an integrated Miele dishwasher and integrated convection/microwave, oven and warming-drawer appliances of the same brand. There is also a huge walk-in pantry, as well as a wraparound laundry-come-scullery with its own tiled bench top, quality tap fittings, internal hanging space and access out to the side of the property.<br/><br/>Away from the minor sleeping quarters lies a spacious front master-bedroom suite of king-size proportions, finished off with gorgeous Cherry wood doors and panels, a ceiling fan, integrated audio speakers in the ceiling, remote-controlled blinds, its own private courtyard deck to absorb those sensual sea breezes from and a huge fitted \"his and hers\" walk-in wardrobe with a built-in safe. A sumptuous ensuite bathroom off here defines relaxation in the form of stylish pendant light fittings, a walk-in ceiling-mounted rain shower, a free-standing bathtub, twin vanities, a toilet, a pleasant view out to the garden and louvers for cross-flow ventilation.<br/><br/>The wildcard in this very unique floor plan though is a massive rear lounge room that is brilliant in its versatility and doubles as a fourth or \"guest\" bedroom suite with a high angled ceiling, media cabinetry, access to a third bathroom (with a walk-in ceiling-mounted rain shower, toilet, funky light fittings, a stone feature wall and under-bench storage) and three separate external doors - linking the zone to a side garden, the main back garden and its own delightful atrium courtyard. Pure bliss - and there is so much more, but you really have to come and see it all for yourself to fully appreciate it.<br/><br/>KEY FEATURES:<br/>\u0095 Tim Wright architect-designed home, completed
