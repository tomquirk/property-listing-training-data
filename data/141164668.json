Backing onto Burleigh Lake, this double-storey home features covered outdoor living on both levels, a sparkling pool and sundeck, spotted gum floors and double-sided fireplace and a traditional timber staircase. Walk to it all, with Burleigh's restaurants, famous beaches, headland track and local markets only a few minutes away.<br/><br/>With parkland on one side, there is only one neighbouring property, granting added peace and seclusion. Positioned behind a lilly pilly-lined front fence, the classic Hamptons colours of grey and vivid white set the tone, highlighted by the richness of dressed timbers. Step onto the portico and into the home through the solid timber entrance door where there is a light-filled dining area edged with tall, double-sash windows. <br/><br/>The log-burning fireplace is set flush into a dividing wall facing the dining while having a freestanding appearance on the living room side. This comfortable lounge space has a weatherboard-style lining feature and sliding doors that open onto one of the two decks that overlook the lake. <br/><br/>Incorporating VJ profile, soft-close cabinetry in white and complementary satin-finish drawer pulls and handles in brushed silver, the kitchen's practical layout includes a large fridge recess, Blanco gas cooktop and wide electric oven and a fully integrated Fisher and Paykel double drawer dishwasher. The kitchen also has a large sliding door to the timber entertainer's deck, with clear caf\u00e9 blinds granting all-weather enjoyment. Well equipped, the large laundry allows an easy thoroughfare from the garage to inside the home, handy when returning with the shopping.<br/><br/>Purposed for dual-living, the air-conditioned guest suite or teenagers retreat situated on the lower level has a lockable French door entry, a kitchenette with glass splashback and full-size fridge space and a large walk-in robe. With the stylish bathroom divided into sections, a convenient powder room on this floor is always available for the homeowner and their visitors.<br/><br/>With timber treads and handrails, white stair risers and balusters, the Hamptons theme is most evident in the staircase leading to the upper level. There is a bank of clerestory windows set near the ceiling and a porthole window at the front of the home, filling the void with natural light.<br/><br/>The two very large bedrooms offer separation and privacy, with meranti-framed French doors opening onto a wide, tiled balcony. Each restful room has lake views and built-in robes, with the master featuring an enormous walk-in robe complete with multi-height hanging and custom shelving and drawers for shoes and jewellery. <br/><br/>A Jack and Jill bathroom with white gloss wall tiles and charcoal-coloured floors provides separately zoned amenities for both bedrooms, aiding efficiency. There is a soothing rain shower and a teak-top vanity with two basins, deep drawer storage and a full-width mirror.<br/><br/>Ironstone Colorbond fences run along the side boundaries with a coastal-style white PVC fence and gateway at the front offering zero maintenance, security and the longevity of a 25-year warranty. A large 5m x 3m Stratco steel shed delivers plenty of extra storage for bikes, surfboards and paddleboards, with the double, semi-enclosed carport's door operated by remote control.<br/><br/>What a convenient location to enjoy all that Burleigh has to offer, allowing you to take an early morning walk around the picturesque Burleigh Headland, spend more time at the beach and enjoy the sunset views over the hinterland. Burleigh locals love their regular market days at either Burleigh Heads State School or along the beachside esplanade, with fresh produce, bakery goods, great coffee and art and craft items available.<br/><br/>This residence is a 10-minute walk from the vibrant restaurants of Burleigh Pavilion and a 4-minute drive to Stockland Burleigh Heads Shopping Centre with its Woolworths, Aldi, Big W and specialty retail stores.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: <br/>This property is being sold by auction or without a price and therefore a price guide cannot be provided.
