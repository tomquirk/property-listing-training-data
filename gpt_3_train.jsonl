A big plus is the amount of living space for a property in this price bracket - a large family lounge in the middle of the house, plus a huge open planned living, dining and kitchen to the rear.  The bedrooms are all a good size, with fans, wardrobes and security screens - plus of course the master has the ensuite and walk in robe.<br/><br/>The yard has lots of space in it, and if rear yard access was important to you, then it would be very straight forward to install a set of double gates, and then you could have off street parking for a camper trailer, caravan or jet ski.

The open en-suite features his and hers vanities and you will absolutely love the amazing rain shower.<br/><br/>The kitchen is the heart of every home and we have literally never seen one like this. The amazing breakfast bar is cleverly designed to seat 6 guests. You could have the most incredible sushi rolling party! Of course there is an expansive stone island bench with clever storage underneath and heaps of soft close drawers. The sink is recessed so that you can easily wipe down the bench when cooking and the clever faucet was custom sourced for this home. There is a professional 6 burner gas stove for the family chef and even a mini butler's pantry to store your espresso machine off the main bench. Rounding out this excellent space is a full walk-in pantry with a custom glass door.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most unique feature of this home is that the 4th bedroom is also a fully self-contained guest suite featuring an extra large living space, kitchenette, sweeping views of the golf course and an en-suite that is better than you will find in most homes. If you have relatives visiting from out of town, a teenager that really needs their own space or an elderly relative... you will never find better accommodation for them.<br/><br/>In the afternoons prevailing sea breezes off of Cleveland Bay keep the fully shaded patio cool. This 643m2 block is located overlooking a beautiful lake and the 5th green... which is the signature hole of the course. There is excellent parking for your golf buggy right in the backyard. It's too bad you can't drive right through the fence (but the entrance to the course is only a few houses away).<br/><br/>The Fairways Estate is located just 10 minutes from the Townsville CBD and only a few minutes walk to the beautiful Ross River walking paths. For those of you viewing this property from out of town, this home is located just minutes away from Townsville's 3 largest employers, James Cook University, Townsville University Hospital and Lavarack Barracks Army Base.<br/><br/>Be Quick!

Kirra developments have had enormous success, with off-the-plan buyers flocking to secure their own piece of beachside paradise. Many developers quoting projects selling out in a matter of weeks, with dozens of ready-to-go buyers missing out.<br/><br/>There has been a DA Approved for this block, now expired, consisting for 9 apartments and totalling 1,132 sqm in internal living space.<br/><br/>This home could also be the last stand-alone home available so close to the beach. If you're looking for your own Kirra beach house - this is it! You're far enough away from the noise of the holiday areas - but close enough that's an easy walk to the beach, caf\u00e9s, shops, bars, restaurants and clubs.<br/><br/>Kirra is the go-to suburb of the southern Gold Coast, and rightly so. The Gold Coast International Airport is only a 5 minute drive away. The state's capital, Brisbane, is only an hour's drive, and Byron Bay is 45 minutes away. The beaches here are north-facing, allowing the predominant south swell to wrap in and creates clean and consistent peeling waves. This is why surfers from all around the world consider the beaches and waves in this area some of the best in the world. This is why developers and city council are heavily investing in the area with projects, light rail and infrastructure.<br/><br/>Agent's notes: This exclusive opportunity will suit anyone looking for a development project or their own beach house. This is the closest stand-alone home to the beach and is positioned in one of the quieter areas of Kirra. No matter what your motivation is - you cannot go wrong with this one.<br/><br/>There are new two developments being built next to this property and close by. Based on the build plans and the building's positioning - there are still good views and privacy for this property at 5 Winston Street. A detailed report on these developments and site plans can be made available by contacting the agent (Ash Witty). END"}

But don't let that scare you off from this brilliant and spacious family home which retains all its retro glory. If you're tickled by the idea of bold, patterned walls and flooring, a sweet selection of chandeliers, and more shades of brown and orange than you could have imagined in one place, you'll be in heaven here. But even if '80s styling isn't for you, there's enormous scope for renovation here - literally, with the footprint of the house itself being over 180sqm.<br/> <br/>Every room in this house is well sized with a considered and therefore excellent floorplan layout, from the bedrooms to the living spaces, and even the laundry. In fact, there's a storeroom off the laundry which is fantastic if you enjoy preserving food, have loads of seasonal clothes or sports equipment, or prefer to shop in bulk. There's a sunroom, which is a beautiful spot where children can play in their own space or you can soak up a few rays while kicking back in your favourite armchair, and attached is a bonus room which is just as versatile. Convert it to a games room, set up a bar and a stereo, and invite friends around for some old-fashioned fun.<br/> <br/>Features Include:<br/>Amazing bones for a fabulous & large family home<br/>3 big bedrooms<br/>1 bathroom<br/>Massive renovation potential with current styling circa 1985<br/>Zoned R12: potential to subdivide into 2 large blocks while retaining the original home<br/><br/>Formal dining room & 2 communal living areas<br/>Plus enclosed patio & bonus room<br/>Large kitchen with double stainless-steel sink, breakfast bar & built-in pantry<br/>Huge main bedroom & large secondary bedrooms<br/>Bathroom with shower, tub & separate powder room<br/>Laundry with double trough & enormous walk-in linen closet<br/>Additional hallway linen cupboards<br/>Wood doors & door frames<br/>Original vintage carpets and tiling<br/>Period style lighting and chandeliers<br/>High ceiling with decorative cornicing<br/>Vertical blinds throughout<br/>2 cooling air-conditioning units<br/>Security screened windows & doors & security alarm<br/>Tiled front verandah with decorative rail<br/>Gas hot water system (approx 3 years old)<br/>Large front lawn area with manual reticulation<br/>Multiple fruit trees<br/>Garden shed<br/>Single car garage<br/>Gated side entry<br/>1935m2 fenced block with subdivision potential<br/> <br/>The large block size of 1935sqm plus the R12.5 zoning means you can potentially subdivide and build a new home out the back while also retaining the current one. Then again, you also have the option of keeping it all to yourself and doing whatever you please with the backyard! There's scope for a complete overhaul as it's a bit of a blank slate at the moment. Also worth noting is that this property is being sold as it is - what you see is what you get! The current owner has never lived in the home so cannot make any guarantees; however the usual process of building and pest inspections will form part of the contract.
